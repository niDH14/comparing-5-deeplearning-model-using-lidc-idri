Lung cancer is one of the hazardous and most common cancers reported globally and is the leading cause of cancer related deaths. There were an estimation of 20 million cases and 9.7 million deaths. The estimated number of people who were alive within 5 years following a cancer diagnosis was 53.5. when calculated among both genders, 1 in 9 men and 1 in 12 women die from the disease.
This research paper ranges over the application of deep learning methods in the realm of lung cancer detection focusing to upgrade the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. The study exploits the dataset (LIDC-IDRI) with various deep learning segmentation models. Our work emphasizes Region of Interest (ROI) prioritization to enhance lung nodule detection efficiency. Utilizing a deep learning model, our approach precisely segments images to identify malignancies.
In the field of medical imaging, image segmentation holds a significant value as it yields reliable and highly accurate results. This technique is popularly used across various image modalities such as CT and MRI scans. The core objective is to transform an image into more comprehensive and meaningful representation that streamlines easy analysis.by extracting Region of Interest (ROI). By splitting the images into certain parts, it simplifies the following processing tasks. These segmented tasks when regathered form a full image. Despite the availability of numerous segmentation methods, their performance can vary significantly.
Moreover our research project aims to compare the performance of various deep learning models. The deep learning models used for image processing is called Convolutional neural network (CNN). Models of this kind are deployed on dedicated graphics processing unit (GPUs) to mitigate latency and foster quick and easier computational process.
 Each patientâ€™s record images have been sliced to reduce image artifacts and provide clear insight into the analysis of affected areas. The primary objective is to determine the top-performing model among the five deep learning models.
